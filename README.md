# KidPromises

A simple crux app that tracks promises you make to your children

## Development

This project is a simple example of using [Crux](https://github.com/redbadger/crux).

### Building Core

To build the core you need to install [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

```shell
brew install just
```

Then run:

```shell
just c
```

You can also run the apple targets from just, but it will run fastlane; see the [apple README.md](./apple/README.md) for directions on that.
